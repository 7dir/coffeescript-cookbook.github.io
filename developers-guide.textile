h1. Developer's Guide

_Please help out by updating this page_

h3. Operating System

It works on Mac OSX. Probably works without any changes or issues on linux. A masochist could probably get it working on Windows.

h2. Installation

h3. Clone the repo

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git://github.com/coffeescript-cookbook/coffeescript-cookbook.github.com.git
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Create a Ruby Gemset

Optional, but highly recommended.

{% highlight bash %}
$ rvm gemset create jekyll
$ echo 'rvm gemset use jekyll' >> .rvmrc
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Install Required Gems

{% highlight bash %}
gem install jekyll   # needed for testing building the site
gem install RedCloth # needed for .textile rendering
gem install serve    # needed for resolving .html files w/o extension
gem install thin     # optional; more efficient webserver than Webrick but not strictly necessary
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Install pygments

You'll need python installed for this. Macs and most linuces come with it preinstalled.

{% highlight bash %}
easy_install pygments   # for syntax highlighting
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Building and Viewing the Website

h3. Run jekyll

Open a terminal window, cd into the project folder and run jekyll from the project root.

{% highlight bash %}
jekyll --auto
{% endhighlight %}

Leave this window running while you work. Any time you change a file, jekyll will rerender it into the <tt>_site</tt> folder.

h3. Run serve

Open another terminal window, cd into the project folder, then cd into the <tt>_site</tt> subfolder, and run

{% highlight bash %}
serve
{% endhighlight %}

This will start a webserver in the <tt>_site</tt> folder. Open a browser and visit <tt>http://localhost:4000/</tt> and you should see the site.

h2. Minituiae and Other Trivialities

jekyll can take a second or two to catch up when you save a file. If you edit a file and don't see the changes in your browser, give it a second or two and try again.
