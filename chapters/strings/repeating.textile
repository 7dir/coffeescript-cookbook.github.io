h2. Problem

You want to repeat a string.

h2. Solution

Create an array of n+1 nulls, and then join it with the repetition string as the glue:

{% highlight coffeescript %}
# create a string of 10 foos
Array(11).join('foo')

# => "foofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoo"
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Discussion

JavaScript lacks a string repeat function, as does CoffeeScript. List comprehensions and maps can be pressed into service here, but in the case of a simple string repeat it's easier to simply build an array of n+1 nulls and then glue them together.
