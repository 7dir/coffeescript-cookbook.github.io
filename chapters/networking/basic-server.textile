h2. Problem

You want to provide a service over a network.


h2. Solution

Create a basic TCP server.

h3. In Node.js

{% highlight coffeescript %}
net = require 'net'

domain = 'localhost'
port = 9001

server = net.createServer (socket) ->
	console.log "Received connection from #{socket.remoteAddress}"
	socket.write "Hello, World!\n"
	socket.end()

console.log "Listening to #{domain}:#{port}"
server.listen port, domain
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Example Usage

Accessed by the <a href="/chapters/networking/basic-client">Basic Client</a>:

{% highlight console %}
$ coffee basic-server.coffee
Listening to localhost:9001
Received connection from 127.0.0.1
Received connection from 127.0.0.1
[...]
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Discussion

The function passed to @net.createServer@ receives the new socket provided for each new connection to a client.  This basic server simply socializes with its visitors but a hard-working server would pass this socket along to a dedicated handler and then return to the task of waiting for the next client.

h3. Exercises
* Add support for choosing the target domain and port based on command-line arguments or from a configuration file.
