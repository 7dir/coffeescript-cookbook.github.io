h2. Problem

You want to repeat a string.

h2. Solution

Use a list comprehension that ignores the list:

{% highlight coffeescript %}
# repeat 'foo' 10 times
('foo' for dummy in [1..10]).join ''
# => "foofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoo"
{% endhighlight %}

Or a simple (but stateful) loop:

{% highlight coffeescript %}
repeatString = (str, times) ->
  s = ''
  while times > 0
    s += str
    --times
  s

repeatString "foo", 10
# => "foofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoo"
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Discussion

JavaScript lacks a string repeat function, as does CoffeeScript. List comprehensions can be pressed into service here, however it remains to be seen if this use is considered idiomatic.
