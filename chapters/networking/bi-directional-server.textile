h2. Problem

You want to provide a service over a network while maintaining a connection with clients.


h2. Solution

Create a bi-directional TCP server.

h3. Node.js

{% highlight coffeescript %}
net = require 'net'

domain = 'localhost'
port = 9001

server = net.createServer (socket) ->
	console.log "New connection from #{socket.remoteAddress}"

	socket.on 'data', (data) ->
		console.log "#{socket.remoteAddress} sent: #{data}"
		others = server.connections - 1
		socket.write "You have #{others} #{others == 1 and "peer" or "peers"} on this server"

console.log "Listening to #{domain}:#{port}"
server.listen port, domain
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Example Usage

Accessed by the <a href="/chapters/networking/bi-directional-client.html">Bi-Directional Client</a>:

*$ coffee bi-directional-server.coffee*
Listening to localhost:9001
New connection from 127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1 sent: Ping
127.0.0.1 sent: Ping
127.0.0.1 sent: Ping
[...]

h2. Discussion

The bulk of the work lies in the _on 'data'_ handler, which processes all of the input from the client.

h3. Exercises
* Add support for choosing the target domain and port based on command-line arguments or from a configuration file.
