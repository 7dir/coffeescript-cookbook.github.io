title: Generating Predictable Random Numbers
chapter: Math

h2. Problem

You need to generate a random number in a certain range, but you also need to be able to "seed" the generator to deliver predictable values.

h2. Solution

Write your own random number generator. There are a LOT of ways to do this. Here's a simple one.

{% highlight coffeescript %}
# TODO: write simple linear PRNG
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Discussion

JavaScript and CoffeeScript do not provide a seedable random number generator. Writing your own will be an exercise in trading off the amount of randomness with the simplicity of the generator. A full discussion of randomness is beyond the scope of this cookbook; for further reading consult Donald Knuths _The Art of Computer Programming_, Volume II.
