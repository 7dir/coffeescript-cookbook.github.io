h2. Problem

You need to calculate when is Thanksgivinig in given year.

h2. Solution

The following functions return the day of Thanksgiving for a given year. If no year is given then current year is used.

In the USA Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November:

{% highlight coffeescript %}

thanksgivingDayUSA = (year = (new Date).getFullYear()) ->
  first = new Date year, 10, 1
  day_of_week = first.getDay()
  22 + (11 - day_of_week) % 7

{% endhighlight %}

In Canada it is the second Monday in October:

{% highlight coffeescript %}

thanksgivingDayCA = (year = (new Date).getFullYear()) ->
    first = new Date year, 9, 1 
    day_of_week = first.getDay()
    8 + (8 - day_of_week) % 7

{% endhighlight %}

h2. Discussion


{% highlight coffeescript %}

thanksgivingDayUSA() #=> 24 (November 24th, 2011)

thanksgivingDayCA() # => 10 (October 10th, 2011)

thanksgivingDayUSA(2012) # => 22 (November 22nd)

thanksgivingDayCA(2012) # => 8 (October 8th)

{% endhighlight %}

The idea is very simple:
# Find out what day of the week is the first day of respective month (November for USA, October for Canada).
# Calculate offset from that day to the next occurrence of weekday required (Thursday for USA, Monday for Canada).
# Add that offset to the first possible date of the holiday (22nd for USA Thanksgiving, 8th for Canada).
